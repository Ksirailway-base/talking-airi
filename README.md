## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and pnpm
- Rust toolchain
- **Whisper** (for audio transcription):
  ```bash
  # Install Whisper via pip
  pip install openai-whisper
  
  # Download recommended model (base model - good balance of speed/accuracy)
  whisper --model base --download-root ~/.cache/whisper
  
  # Alternative: smaller model for faster processing
  whisper --model tiny --download-root ~/.cache/whisper
  ```

### Installation

```shell
# Install dependencies
pnpm i
# Run desktop version with Live2D enhancements
pnpm dev:tamagotchi
```
